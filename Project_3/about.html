                <p class="second_p">Realm of Design is an award-winning,  family owned and operated company that was established in 1991 by founders Scott and Cindy McCombs in the heart of Las Vegas.  The foundation of the company was based on providing designers, architects, builders and home owners with the most breathtaking architectural elements the world has ever seen. Our devotion to customer satisfaction, along with an unlimited combination of design variations and materials give us the capability of making any design a reality.</p>
                <p>The man behind the curtain, Scott McCombs has been specializing in architectural elements for over 20 years. He has vast history of custom projects, including Frank Lloyd Wright’s “The Realm of Ideas”,  which entailed the recreation of “Usonian Automatic Exhibition House” that was erected in 10 different cities touring the United States from 1988 to 1990.  His same passion and excitement has been passed onto his family, which comprises almost one third of the company. With the family’s various positions throughout the company, along with Scott’s previous experience in the fields of construction, design, building, and engineering,</p>

              <p class="first_p">Realm of Design brings forth the best designs and new architectural concepts for commercial and residential projects.  Being a dedicated environmentalist, Scott is constantly working to minimize the company’s impact on the environment.  So he created and holds the patent for Green Architectural Stone (aka GreenStone) which is a building element made from 100% recycled glass aggregate and 99.8% renewable materials.</p>
              <p class="second_p">Technology is a very important part of the company and  is thought to be the most advanced in our industry. Using 3D scanners, 3D modeling, and a 5-axis Computer Numerical Control machine we have the leading edge. These tools allow endless possibilities, including face recreation, rapid prototyping, 2D and 3D renderings, sculpted stone, clay, wood, and much more. Although technology is important, it is the artistic hand-touch put into each piece that sets us apart.  Together with our creative in-house artisans, along with Scott and Cindy’s artistic creativity and attention to detail, being master artisans themselves, Realm of Design can bring you the most divine, custom hand-crafted pieces that reflect a range from old world style to modern contemporary design.
